# SQL_PizzaHut_Project
# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze pizza sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, revenue generation, and sales trends. The analysis covers basic, intermediate, and advanced queries to extract valuable information from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains multiple tables related to pizza orders, including order details, pizza types, categories, and pricing. The necessary data preprocessing and SQL queries are used to extract meaningful insights.

# Analysis Questions

## Basic Analysis

Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

Identify the highest-priced pizza.

Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

## Intermediate Analysis

Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

## Advanced Analysis

Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
